hack much? we're starting a bold new hackerspace in santa cruz, ca, and we need your help. 

are you into robotics, quantum cryptography, aerospace engineering, photovoltaics, metal 3d printing, alternative energy, moonsteading, peer production, rocketry, neural networks, waterjet cutting, econophysics, interactive art, proteomics, open source, low-energy nuclear reactions, picosatellites, electromagnetic propulsion, bioengineering, mixed reality, fuel cells, superconductors, nanoelectromechanics, holography, metaprogramming, plasma acceleration, laser cutting, distributed ledgers, grid computing, neurocybernetics, terraforming, integrated circuit design, electric airplanes, or anything remotely related? 

we're an accomplished bunch of radical inclusionists, applied artist-scientists, and self-propelled transdisciplinarians fed up with hidden agendas and arbitrary constraints imposed by bureaucracies, corporations, megalomaniacs, and charlatans. so we're building our own moonshot factory, darpa, ideo, jpl, skunk works, and whatnot all rolled into one: a transformative hackerspace 2.0 with an expansive vision for a better world that empowers individuals through community. 

combine your skills and ideas with ours for bigger oomph. text [831-288-5850](sms:+1-831-288-5850) or email <chris@hackervillage.net>
